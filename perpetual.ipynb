    "- The funding rate is higher (lower) the higher (lower) the derivative trades above (below) the underlying index.\n",
    "- Every 8h the long position pays the short position - vice versa if the funding rate is negative.\n",
    "- The perpetual swaps is the most popular financial instruments in crypto markets. Perpetual swaps account for USD 75-125 billion daily traded volume, whereas 40-60% is traded on Binance.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crypto markets have some interesting unique properties.\n",
    "- Due to the absence of prime broker and scattered trading venues, margins might be posted seperately for both sides of the trade. This makes trading capital intensive.\n",
    "- Trading in crypto markets occurs 24/7. Regular cash-settled future instruments (e.g. as offered by the Chicago CME) has low demand, due to the troubles of managing margin during non-banking hours."
